4.4.0 ChangeLog (Unity 2018.3.0f2 and higher versions)

Fixes

1) Fixed Null Reference Bug when trying to add terrain to Slice Configuration File.

New Features

1) 	Terrain Slicing functionality has been updated to take new 2018.3 features into account. New terrain settings from 2018.3 
	will be copied to slices. In addition, a new option has been adding to Slice Configuration Files called "Copy Texture Layers Exactly." 
	This option, when enabled, forces your slices to use the exact terrain layers from your base terrain. With this option disabled, duplicate 
	terrain layers are created for each slice, which will probably be necessary in most instances.

4.3.3 ChangeLog (Unity 5.5.0f3 and higher version)

File Changes

1)	Removed all javascript files at the request of Unity Asset Store.

Fixes

1)	Fixed a bug causing columns and layers to be loaded at incorrect positions when using world re-centering and a 
	origin cell other than column = 1 or layer = 1.

2)	Restored Script Execution Ordering of World, Active Grid, and Component Manager 
	scripts, which were mistakenly removed in previous update.

3)	Fixed Group Range Fields when slicing a group using the Slice Configuration File.

4)	Removed warning about not being in orthographic mode when slicing a group.

5)	Fixed a bug causing unwanted game objects to be included in scenes generated using Scene Generation Files.

6)	Updated Platform dependent compilation statements in SliceConfigurationFileEditor.cs file, which should eliminate some errors on Unity 4.6 and Unity 4.7 versions, 
	as well as add support for new properties in later versions of Unity when slicing. 

7)	Fixed a null reference exception that would occur when selecting a World Grid asset on Unity versions lower than 
	5.4.1f.

8)	Fixed unreachable code in AssetBundleLoader script.

9)	Fixed issues causing warnings in console window.

10)	Fixed SetNeighbors bug introduced in last update.

Improvements

1)	Added a new Primary Cell Object Sub Controller called DistanceBasedPrimaryCellObjectSubController. This component works similar to the pooling sub controller, except the 
	cell objects are removed once the player moves some user defined distance from the cell that the object belongs to.

2)	Unity 5.5+ version now utilizes the new SceneManager.UnloadSceneAsync method to unload scenes, which should improve performance.
	Note that this will only work if you are using a Scene Loader (as your cell object loader) and are not using a Cell Object Destroyer 
	(as that will be used if it is present).

3)	Added option for setting static flags (static lightmapper, occluder, etc.) of slices when using Slice Configuration Files. 
	You can choose to copy the static flags from the base terrain or set the static flags of the slices manually (so they are 
	different than the base terrain).  

4)	Added icons for World Grid and Slice Configuration File assets, to better differentiate them from other assets in the Project Hierarchy.


4.3.2 ChangeLog

Fixes

1)	Fixed a null reference exception that would sometimes occur when adding a World Grid asset to the World Grid 
	field on the World component.


4.3.1 ChangeLog

Fixes 

1) 	Fixed an issue where using a slicing region with a normalized position other than x = 0, z = 0 would result in innaccurate splat maps 
	on slices.

2) 	When slicing, moving the slicing region via the transform handle in the scene view now correctly updates the 
	normalized position in the inspector correctly, and any position change via this method is persistent 
	(previously the changes would revert after a period of time).

3) 	Removed Duplicate Input Group Name field on Scene Generation File.


Improvements

1)	Updated the Unity 5 example scenes to utilize the Async Prefab Instantiator

2)	Updated the Dynamic Loading Setup Quick Guide to reflect the replacement of the Scene Generation Editor 
	Window Tool with the Scene Generation File

Notes

1)	Incorrect DLL GUIDs were introduced in the Unity 4 version. They are now corrected, but updating the package 
	will not fix the incorrect GUIDs. You will need to do this manually. Please visit 
	www.deepspacelabs.net/html/dynamic_loading/learning_guid_issues.html for more information.


4.3.0 ChangeLog

New Features

1)	Added Asset Bundle support. When creating scenes, you can have the scenes assigned to an asset bundle 
	of the same name (with a lowercase first letter), as well as a variant.

2)	A new Cell Object Loader called the Asset Bundle Loader has also been added which allows you to 
	utilize Asset Bundles. Using this component requires some setup, so please take a look at the 
	Asset Bundle Quick Guide found in the instructions/Quick Guides folder. 

3)	Added Async Prefab Instantiator component (new Cell Object Loader) to Unity 5 version to take advantage 
	of new Resources.LoadAsync method in Unity API.

4)	Added new option to Primary Cell Object Sub Controllers, Memory Freeing Strategy. Based on the 
	choice for this option, the controller will automatically call the Resources.UnloadUnusedAssets 
	and/or GC.Collect (or neither, in which case you should call them manually) after 
	destroying one or more cell objects (one call is initiated per group of cell objects, 
	after all of them have been destroyed).

5)	Added Post Slice Processors. These can be used to run custom code before or after each slice is generated, 
	allowing you to do a variety of things, such as creating custom sliced materials.


API Changes

1)	New event (CellPlayerIsInChanged) added to the Active Grid class. This event fires when the endless 
	grid cell the player is in changes, as well as when desyncing or syncing from/to a world. It is 
	not called when the Active Grid is first initialized and objects loaded. You should use the methods 
	of the World class to find out what grid the player is in at this time instead.

2)	CellObject property on WorldCell class exposed, allowing you to get access to the underlying primary 
	game object associated with a cell.

3)	CellUsers property on WorldCell class exposed, allowing you to see how many users the cell has. 
	This is probably only useful for debugging purposes.

3)	Terrain property on WorldCellWithTerrain class exposed, allowing you to get access to the underlying 
	terrain associated with a cell.

4)	You can now also get access to the Terrain Neighbors of a given WorldCellWithTerrain via the 
	LeftNeighbor, RightNeighbor, TopNeighbor and BottomNeighbor properties.

5)	Updated Unity 5 version to use new Scene Management classes.


Slicing Tool (Slice Configuration File) Changes

1)	Added option to slicing tool (Don't Slice Alphamap) to allow you to ignore the alphamap on base terrain. 
	This is useful if you are using a custom shader that does not need the slices to have alphamaps.

2)	Added another option to slicing tool (Copy Splat Textures) which is displayed if the Don't Slice Alphamap
	option is checked. Enabling this option forces the slicer to copy all splat textures from the 
	base terrain to the slices, which might be useful to some. Note, however, that this will cause an alphamap 
	to be generated on each slice (or multiple alphamaps if using more than 4 textures).


Fixes

1)	Fixed Folder Path Copy Operations in Unity 5 version.

2)	Fixed a crash when updating empty/not empty designation of cells on a World Grid with only 1 row, 
	column, and layer.

3)	Fixed a bug in the TryMakeCellOriginCell method (ActiveGrid class) that would cause new cells to be 
	loaded in the wrong position.

4)	Fixed a bug in the TryDesyncFromCurrentWorld method that caused the Active Grid to stay in 
	a busy state, even after the desync finished.

5)	Editor classes have been written to utilize the Serialized Object/Property system. 
	In addition to fixing serialization issues with Unity 5.3 and greater, the new classes take 
	advantage of the built in undo operations.

Miscellaneous

1)	Added new example scene showcasing manual initialization of the Component Manager over multiple frames. Manual, gradual initialization is great 
	for loading your world/s post Awake/Start while the game is running (which is typically how most games do it), and it makes it very easy to display a loading screen.

2)	Better Intellisense support.


4.2.3 ChangeLog

Fixes (API)

1)	The TryGetWorldCellPositionIsIn and TryGetWorldCellAssociatedWithEndlessGridCell methods of the World class have had their 
	return values changed from void to bool, which brings them in line with standard C# coding standards.

4.2.2 Changelog

Improvements/Updates to Existing Features

1)	Exposed the Terrain property on the WorldCellWithTerrain class, as well as the neighbor properties 
	(LeftNeighbor, TopNeighbor, RightNeighbor, BottomNeighbor). These changes will allow you to access the Terrain associated with a 
	World Cell (assuming you are using Terrains), as well as the neighboring World Cells of any given World Cell.

4.2.1 Changelog

Fixes

1)	Fixed a bug with Terrain Slicing Tool that would cause the terrain slices and terrain slice data to be improperly named (which would 
	also cause the alphamap blending to not work properly).

2)	Fixed a bug with Terrain Slicing Tool that would cause detail meshes from the base terrain to be set to an incorrect detail mesh
	on the slice when the "Copy All Detail Meshes" option was checked.

4.2.0 Changelog

New Features

1)	Added new component type, the ObjectGroup. An Object Group is a secondary group that can be loaded on top of your Worlds 
	(think houses,	scene objects, etc.). By using Object Groups, you only need to create one World and World Grid to define the base 
	terrain/objects of your scene; Object Groups will simply utilize that information. In addition, you can configure the order in which 
	object groups are loaded. In addition to ensuring that your base terrain/objects are loaded before the object groups, this also allows 
	you to setup one object group to load before another.
	Note this change necessitated a modification to the base PrimaryCellObjectSubController and CellObjectLoader classes that will 
	break all of your existing custom components that derive from them. To fix this, make the following changes in your custom components:

	a)	All World parameters must be changed to ICellObjectGroup parameters (it's likely only the Register and CreateNewUser 
		methods need to be modified).

	b)	Any code that retrieved information directly from the World must be modified to use the properties of the ICellObjectGroup 
		interface instead. This interface contains a World property, so all information that was previously available is still available. 
		Note however, that you should use the GroupName and NamingConvention properties 	of the ICellObjectGroup object rather than the 
		World object, as the ICellObjectGroup properties will be accurate for both Worlds and ObjectGroups, whereas the World properties 
		will only be accurate for Worlds.

2)	Added new asset type, the Naming Convention asset. This asset allows you to alter the default naming convention used by the kit 
	in various places, including the World Grid Scriptable Object, Scene Generation Tool, and Terrain Slicer Tool.

3)	New Quick Guides added. In addition to a quick guide for Object Groups and the Naming Convention asset, a quick guide detailing 
	runtime created Worlds and Active Grids is now available. The existing quick guides have also been updated to take the new Naming 
	Convention asset into account.

4)	Unity 5 version of package added.

Improvements/Updates to Existing Features

1)	The World Grid has been updated with a new method to set its data. While the old methods can still be used, I think you'll find 
	this new method more intuitive and easier to use. The World Grid also has a new visual grid system (which is also used by Object Groups),  
	which shows you which cells in the grid are empty or not empty.

2)	The World component's preview functionality (allowing you to add the objects of your world to the scene) has been improved to allow 
	for the loading of object groups and the use of the World's Naming Convention.

3)	Added CopyBaseLayer and CopyBaseTag options to Terrain Slicing Tool. When enabled, each slice's layer and tag will be set to the layer 
	and tag of the base terrain you are slicing. If disabled, each slice's layer will be set to the default layer and "Untagged" respectively 
	(this is the current behavior).

4)	Updated the Scene Generation Tool. You can now specify a range of scenes to generate, which can be used to regenerate a subset of scenes 
	from a group rather than the entire group. The scene generation tool will also now correctly overwrite a scene in the Build Settings rather 
	than leaving in duplicate entries. The tool also now makes use of the new naming convention asset.

5)	Each scene generated using the scene generation tool will use all scene settings from whatever scene you have open when the tool is run. 
	This is mostly useful for Unity 5 users, as it ensures lighting/bake settings are the same across all scenes.

6)	The Cell struct now only has a single constructor with row, column, and layer parameters. You may see errors relating to this when you update to 4.2. Simply add a 1 argument to your Cell constructor calls.

Fixes

1)	Fixed a bug when using the ComponentManager.Initialize method from another scripts Awake method that would cause the objects/terrain 
	loaded by the DLK to not be made visible.

2)	Fixed a bug in the Pooling Primary Cell Object Sub Controller that would cause terrain not be unloaded/loaded properly, resulting in a 
	NullReferenceException and some other less common issues.


4.1.1 Changelog
1)	Fixed several bugs that would cause some terrain/objects to remain improperly activated.

2)	Optimized the origin centering technique when "Perform Shift Activation In Single Frame" is enabled. Existing cells
	will now be re-positioned rather than rebuilding the entire world from scratch.

3)	When re-centering the world, the world will now use the transform associated with the Active Grid that initiated the World re-centering
	to calculate the new origin cell.

4.1.0 Changelog
1)	The Terrain Slicing Tool has been dramatically improved. To slice a terrain, create a
	a Slice Configuration File via Terrain -> Terrain Slicing Kit -> Create Slice Configuration File,
	provide a valid terrain (from the scene or a prefab), and press the button to slice at the bottom of the inspector
	(Take a look at the Terrain_Slicing_Guide.pdf file for a detailed overview of how everything works).

2)	New option added to Active Grid component. This "Active Grid Type" option controls the layout of the active grid. The 
	default option "Outer_Ring_Grid" will force the Active Grid to use the same layout it's used in the past, with an inner area and 
	outer ring. The new option, "Sectioned_Grid" is a special layout consisting of either 4 (for 2D worlds) or 8 (for 3D worlds) cells.
	The specifics can be found in the Active Grid quick guide, but know that the main benefit of this layout is a reduction 
	of the minimum number of cells (from 9 to 4).

3)	New method added to Active Grid component, TryMakeCellOriginCell. This can only be used if the Active Grid is the only user of 
	the World it is synced to. This method will try to make the passed in Cell the Origin Cell of the World the Active Grid is 
	synced to. You can pass in a position within this cell (at the Origin Cell position) to move the player to after the change 
	has taken place. This can be used to move the player to a different part of the World, while keeping the world close to the 
	origin. More information on this method will be added in the future; for now, please contact me if you have any questions.

4)	New optional option (setPlayerYPositionBasedOnTerrain) added to the following ActiveGrid methods: TryMovePlayerToLocation, TryMovePlayerToLocationOnNewWorld, and 
	TrySyncToNewWorldAroundPlayer. When this option is set to true, the DLK will attempt to position the player's y position in relation 
	to the Terrain at either the location passed in (for TryMovePlayerToLocation and TryMovePlayerToLocationOnNewWorld) or the player's 
	current position (for TrySyncToNewWorldAroundPlayer). The is very useful, as it means you don't have to predetermine the correct y 
	position ahead of time. This can only be used when the Active Grid is synced to or is going to be 
	synced to a world that uses Unity Terrains. You can also specify a playerYOffset so the player is spawned some units above the terrain (
	to avoid overlap).

5)	Exposed the Origin Cell property on the World component, which controls what cell is set to the world's origin at the beginning 
	of the game. By adjusting the origin cell row, column, and layer, you can force 
	the world to act like it's already been re-centered. This is useful for extremely large worlds, where you need the player 
	to start in an area not near the first row/column/layer of the World, but you want to keep the player's actual position close to the origin.

6)	New option (Perform Shift Activation In Single Frame) added to World component when "Keep World Centered Around Origin" is checked. 
	When this option is enabled, the new shifted world will be activated and old non shifted world deactivated in a single frame. This can 
	be useful for eliminating flickering in some cases. Please hover over the option in the inspector to view some additional crucial 
	information regarding this option.

7)	When "Keep World Centered Around Origin" is checked on the World component, you will now see 6 boundary fields instead of 3.
	Rather than set one value for the east/west boundary distance from origin, you can now set the boundaries individually, i.e., you can 
	make the west boundary 0 units from the origin while the east boundary is 500 units away. The same goes for the north/south and top/bottom 
	boundaries. Note that the west, south, and bottom boundary distances will start at  their default value of 0, so you may need to adjust them.
	
8)	If a folder path contains the world "Assets" when using the Copy Relative Folder Path 
	command, it will no longer be incorrectly removed when pasting.

9)	Eliminated runtime garbage generation from Boundary Monitor component.

10)	All public methods and classes that use the Cell struct will now expect the first row/column of the world 
	to start at 1 (previously it expected them to start at 0). This brings the script row/column/layer numbering 
	format in line with the editor format.

11) Changed the player in the example scenes to a flying camera, eliminating the issue where the player can fall off the world.

4.0.0 Changelog
1)	Made the kit Unity 5 compatible.

2)	Fixed a bug where an inactivated object would not be reactivated properly when using
	the Pooling Primary Sub Controller component.

3)	Removed some instructional items that were no longer needed, including old change logs.

4)	Added new Quick Guide detailing first time setup of the kit. This can be found in 
	the TerrainSlicing/Instructions/QuickGuides folder.

5)	 Moved all non DLL C# classes out of the Unity Global Namespace and provided 
	explicit namespaces for all JavaScript classes using classes inside the TerrainSlicingKit 
	namespace. This should rectify any and all namespace conflicts.
