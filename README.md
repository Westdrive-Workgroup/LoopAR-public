## Introduction
### Important Notice:
For better ease of use we have devided the project into two seperate repositories, one containing 3d assets and model called Westdrive Assets Foundation and the other
for functionalities of Westdrive which is called Westdrive Core. One can use these two repositories combined or separetely to create their own simulation outside the scope of 
senarios existing in this version of Westdrive. 

you can find the [Westdrive Assets Foundation](https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-asset-foundation) here : https://gitlab.com/farbod69/westdrive-asset-foundation

## Testing Releases:
### VR Version:
- You will need to be in possissons of HTC Vive Pro Eye
- You need SteamVR and Tobii XR installed on the system
> if you have never used Tobii Eyetracker inside HTC Vive Pro Eye before you have to first accept their term of use and enable the eye tacker from StreamVR main environment before running Projoct LoopAR

### None VR Version:
-You just need the executable of the project. 

## remarks on the project
- the project has been tested on Nvidia 2080 Ti as well as Nvidia GTX 1070 yielding a performance stable around 60 FPS

Note: 
The executable release is meant to be a showcase of the current LoopAR Alpha capabilities. Westdrive is meant to be customized and built for your specific needs. So we recommend you to download the code and build it yourself after implementing your own scenarios.

Note:
We still consider LoopAR in alpha phase, This is currently under the status of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) meaning it only implements the main functionalities of LoopAR. There will be many features that will be added during the mounths to come. 
We will always push the stable changes to the public LoopAR repository

## Builded version
-you can download the standalone VR version [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bBagKateS1WYV0HRvFxZbwWId148Rayk/view?usp=sharing)

## Build prepration
in the following section, it is explained how you can clone and improt the project for build and developement inside Unity environment.
### Step one: Preparing Unity
please [download](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) the corresponding version Unity and install it on your machine. It is highly recommended to 
download and install Unity through [Unity Hub](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHubSetup.exe?_ga=2.187579435.2096600450.1550663193-640931691.1544444769).

### Step two: cloning the project
First make sure you have installed a git client on you machine. If you need one you can find many of them online. Alternatively you can just [download](https://desktop.github.com/) and install
official Github client for Microsot Windows. 
> if you just want to use Project westdrive you can alternatively dowload the project as an archive file (see below), however to contribute to the project or make your own forks you will need a Github [account](https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home).
